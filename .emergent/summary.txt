The previous AI engineer meticulously developed a full-stack web application for Taxi Türlihof, starting from a basic prompt. The development trajectory primarily focused on frontend implementation, iteratively enhancing the UI/UX based on detailed user feedback. Key accomplishments include setting up a modern, responsive design with a black-yellow theme, integrating company-specific content like services, pricing, fleet, and contact information, and implementing advanced features such as a dynamic price calculator and floating action buttons. A significant portion of the work involved refining content accuracy (prices, contact details, service areas) and user experience (button placement, font styles). The engineer also performed crucial SEO optimizations and began integrating real Google My Business review data. The primary technical challenge encountered was the accurate distance calculation for the price calculator, which remained a recurring issue despite multiple mock-based attempts, leading towards considering Google Maps API integration. The current state is a feature-rich frontend with robust branding and contact mechanisms, with backend development for features like the contact form pending.

<product_requirements>
The user, operating Taxi Türlihof in Luzern, Schwyz, and Zug, requested a professional, modern, and responsive website in German. The core problem is to provide an accessible online presence for their taxi service, allowing customers to easily find information, calculate fares, and contact them.

**Key features explicitly requested and implemented:**
*   **Company Branding:** Integration of company name Taxi Türlihof, website www.taxitürlihof.ch, logo, and a user-provided taxi image.
*   **Contact Information:** Display of email () and phone number ().
*   **Service Overview:** Detailed listing of taxi services (Flughafentransfer, Stadtfahrten, Geschäftsfahrten, Kurierfahrten) with initial pricing, later refined to Nach Vereinbarung for most.
*   **Pricing:** Specific fare structure (Grundtarif CHF 6.60, pro Kilometer CHF 4.20, Wartezeit CHF 73.00/Stunde) and airport transfer prices (Zürich, Basel from Luzern, Schwyz, Zug).
*   **Coverage Area:** Listing of service regions including Luzern, Schwyz, and Zug, with an expanded list of specific villages.
*   **Payment Methods:** Display of accepted payment options (Bargeld, Kreditkarten, Girocard, SumUp, TWINT, PayPal) with their respective logos.
*   **Fleet Gallery:** Showcase of the taxi fleet using user-provided Mercedes images in a carousel.
*   **Interactive Contact:** Floating action buttons for direct calls, WhatsApp, and email, initially placed side-by-side, then refined to have a dedicated phone button and a 'Plus' button for other options.
*   **Price Calculator:** A fare calculation tool based on start/destination, initially with mock distances, which was a recurring point of correction.
*   **Design & UI/UX:** Bolder font, consistent black-yellow theme, responsive design, professional layout, and subtle animations.
*   **SEO Optimizations:** Comprehensive meta tags, Open Graph, Twitter Cards, Local Business Schema, geo-targeting, and alt-tags.
*   **Google My Business Integration:** Display of real business address and review statistics (5.0 stars, 39 reviews).

**Implementation Done So Far:**
A fully functional and visually appealing frontend has been built. All user-specified content, branding elements, service details, and interactive components are in place, leveraging  components for a modern look. The price calculator is functional but still struggles with accurate distance calculation (using mock data). SEO has been applied, and a visible reviews section is in the process of being added. The website is currently mock-data-driven, awaiting backend integration for dynamic features like the contact form.

- **Price Calculator Accuracy:** The distance calculation in the  is still mock-based and inaccurate; the user requested like Google Maps reckoning, implying a need for Google Maps Distance Matrix API integration.
- **Reviews Section Integration:** The  component has been created but needs to be rendered in the  or another main component.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was working on integrating the user's real Google My Business review data into the website. The  file was updated with the actual address Türlihof 4, 6414 Arth, Switzerland and the review statistics (5.0 stars, 39 reviews). A new component, , was created to display these reviews. However, this  component has not yet been added to the main  (or any other parent component) to be visibly rendered on the website. The user's last message, Ja bitte, was an affirmation to integrate this section visibly after stating Ich sehe keine Bewertungen.
