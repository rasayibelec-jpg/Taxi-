The AI engineer successfully guided the Taxi Türlihof project from an initial MVP to a feature-rich, production-ready website. Key phases included integrating Google My Business reviews, establishing a functional contact form with Gmail SMTP, and implementing a comprehensive online booking system. A major iterative challenge was the price calculator's accuracy, initially mock-based, then an intelligent estimation, finally resolving with full Google Maps Distance Matrix API integration. The engineer meticulously addressed user feedback, including fixing email configurations, correcting geographical data for pricing, and refining UI elements like navigation links, WhatsApp buttons, and service area descriptions with images and detailed local content. The process was highly iterative, demonstrating adaptability to changing user requirements and a strong focus on technical precision and user experience.

<product_requirements>
The user, operating Taxi Türlihof in Luzern, Schwyz, and Zug, required a professional, modern, and responsive German website to provide an online presence for their taxi service. The primary goal was to allow customers to easily find information, calculate fares, and book rides.

**Key features explicitly requested and implemented:**
*   **Company Branding & Contact:** Integration of Taxi Türlihof, www.taxiturlihof.ch (corrected from .ch with umlaut), logo, and contact info (phone 076 611 31 31, email info@taxiturlihof.ch).
*   **Service Overview:** Detailed listing of services (Flughafentransfer, Stadtfahrten, Geschäftsfahrten, Kurierfahrten) with individual images, initially with pricing, later Nach Vereinbarung for most.
*   **Pricing:** Specific fare structure (Grundtarif, pro Kilometer, Wartezeit) with consistent pricing across vehicle types (all Grundtaxe CHF 6.60, Standard CHF 4.20/km, Premium/Van CHF 5.00/km).
*   **Coverage Area:** Initially a list of villages, later expanded to detailed, localized descriptions with colors and icons for Luzern, Vierwaldstättersee, Weggis & Vitznau, Schwyz & Brunnen, Zug, Arth-Goldau.
*   **Payment Methods:** Display of accepted payment options with logos.
*   **Fleet Gallery:** Carousel of Mercedes taxi images.
*   **Interactive Contact:** Floating action buttons for call, WhatsApp (fixed from blocked links to ), and email.
*   **Price Calculator:** Fare calculation tool based on start/destination, initially mock-based, then an intelligent Swiss estimation, finally integrated with **Google Maps Distance Matrix API** for precise distances (e.g., Luzern Bahnhof to Zürich Hauptbahnhof at 52.52km). All time-based surcharges were removed for uniform pricing.
*   **Online Booking System:** Full functionality for immediate and scheduled taxi bookings, with email confirmations to customer and business, vehicle type selection, and precise pricing. The booking type selection was later simplified to Online Buchen (always scheduled).
*   **Reviews:** Display of Google My Business reviews (5.0 stars, 39 reviews) with a functional Bewertungen navigation link and a QR code for easy mobile reviewing.
*   **Design & UI/UX:** Bolder font, black-yellow theme, responsive design, animations.
*   **SEO Optimizations:** Comprehensive meta tags, Open Graph, Twitter Cards, Local Business Schema, geo-targeting.

**Implementation Done So Far:**
A fully functional and visually appealing full-stack application has been built, covering all explicit user requests. The frontend is responsive and content-rich, with  components. The FastAPI backend handles contact form submissions, booking logic, and real-time distance calculations via Google Maps API. MongoDB stores contact and booking data. Email notifications are fully functional using Gmail SMTP. The system is production-ready.

Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing the user's request to add more content under the Unsere Servicegebiete (Our Service Areas) section. The user's last explicit request was resilerin altina eklermisin which translates to can you add [it] under the pictures/areas. This indicates that additional content, likely textual or visual, is to be placed below the recently updated, color-coded, and icon-enhanced service area cards in the  component. The AI engineer has just acknowledged this request and is preparing to implement it.
